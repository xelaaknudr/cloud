Titanic is a good movie. I am not one of those who believe that it is a masterpiece and that if someone has not seen the film, then they have missed a lot.

The cast is amazing. I watched this film for the first time as a child, and then I was sure that it was a documentary, and what was shown in the past is a true story.

The visual component is just super. Everything is done according to modern technologies

There is no point in telling about the plot. A love story set in the early twentieth century with excellent visuals. My favorite in this film is the juxtaposition of the past and the present. The end makes you cry over a sad story.

Do you know that the budget of the painting, which amounted to $ 200 million, is one third higher than the cost of building the real Titanic

Once again, you can make sure that Cameron is a truly brilliant director. From a simple script, he was able to make a good film.
